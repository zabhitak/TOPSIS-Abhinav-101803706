        A package for python implemetation of TOPSIS method for multiple criteria decision making
        
        It is a method of compensatory aggregation that compares a set of alternatives by identifying weights for each criterion, normalising scores for each criterion and calculating the geometric distance between each alternative and the ideal alternative, which is the best score in each criterion.</h4>
        
        
        Instructions to run:
        1. [Download the package](https://pypi.org/project/TOPSIS-Abhinav-101803706/0.1/)
        2. Goto to code editor and open the code file. 
        3. Write down "pip install TOPSIS-Abhinav-101803706" on the terminal to download it 
        4. Usage python topsis.py <InputDataFile> <Weights> <Impacts> <ResultFileName> to run the file and result file will be saved with topsis score and rank.
